# RNN
This Jupyter notebook contains an implementation of a recurrent neural network (RNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). Some theoretical questions about these architectures are also answered. 
This work has been submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the "Deep Learning" course - MSc AI&ML of Imperial College London.
